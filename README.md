In the project we implemented the interfaces, There are five classes which we will use in order to implement for each interface. 
   (We will to represent  the  classes by its sectiones).

* Name of Interfaces : EdgeData ,NodeData , GeoLocation, DirectedWeightedGraph , DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms.
* Name of Classes :    Edge , Node , Geo_Location , Graph ,GraphAlgo.

**Node class function:**

**The First Class is Called "Node" :
 This class represents the individual Vertex in a (directional) weighted graph , by implementing the interface in the code "NodeData".**

 *In this class that performs the following steps:*


public int getKey();
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/**
	 * Returns the key (id) associated with this node.
	 * @return
	 */
  ////////////////////
