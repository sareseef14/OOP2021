In the project we implemented the interfaces, There are five classes which we will use in order to implement for each interface. 
(We will to represent  the  classes by its sectiones).

-Name of Interfaces : EdgeData ,NodeData , GeoLocation, DirectedWeightedGraph , DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms.
-Name of Classes :EdgeData , NodeData , GeoLocation , Graph ,GraphAlgo.

__Node class function:

__The First Class is Called "NodeClass" : This class represents the individual Vertex in a (directional) weighted graph , by implementing the interface in the code "NodeData".

_ _In this class we will perform the following steps:

# The largest heading
